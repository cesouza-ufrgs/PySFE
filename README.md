# PySFE
A simple finite element code written in Python, for educational purposes.

The code was initially created for Octave, during the classes of course DEM1091 Introduction to Finite Element Method, in 2015-2016, at the Mechanical Engineering Department of UFSM (www.ufsm.br).

In 2019, the code was translated to Python, but now using gmsh as post-processor. The initial version contains only a 2d bar finite element, but soon more codes will be uploaded.

## Usage
The code is developed in Linux, and is meant to be run from command line:
>>./PyFE.py <path-to-file/input_file>

If everything goes well, an output file will be created for GMSH post-processing.

### Examples
Two examples can be found in folder 'models'. All keywords necessary to run a model are present in both files.
